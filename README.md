# TRAFFIC-FLOW-PREDICTION
This project aims to predict traffic flow based on historical data, including vehicle counts (cars, bikes, buses, trucks), time, and day of the week. By analyzing this data, we seek to identify patterns in traffic flow, predict traffic situations, and provide actionable insights to manage congestion and improve urban mobility.
